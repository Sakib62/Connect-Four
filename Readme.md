<h2><b>Connect 4:</b></h2>
<p>
Connect-Four is a tic-tac-toe-like two-player game in which players alternately place pieces on a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high. Each player uses pieces of a particular color (commonly black and red, or sometimes yellow and red), and the object is to be the first to obtain four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Because the board is vertical, pieces inserted in a given column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column. As soon as a column contains 6 pieces, it is full and no other piece can be placed in the column.

<p>
Both players begin with 21 identical pieces, and the first player to achieve a line of four connected pieces wins the game. If all 42 shots are played and no player has places four pieces in a row, the game is drawn.

<h2><b>Our Project:</b></h2>
<br>
❖ In this project, we plan to create a digital version of the classic Connect 4 game entirely coded in C.
<br><br>
❖ The baseline project is that we build a command line version of the game, which prints the Board Layout, the Player Symbols, and any prompts or messages in plain ASCII text.
<br><br>
❖ It has two mode.<br>
    
1. <b>Multi Player Mode:</b> <i>It would facilitate 2 human players to play the game.</i><br><br>

2. <b>Single Player Mode:</b> <i>One player would play against an AI bot built using the minimax algorithm.</i><br><br>

❖ Possible enhancements would include a proper GUI to the game with appropriate animations, using the graphics.h header-file.
